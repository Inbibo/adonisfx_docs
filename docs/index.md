# Introduction

Welcome to the technical documentation of Adonis where we provide all the information and knowledge required to configure and use it on your digital characters.

### The Values of Adonis

Adonis is a fast and intuitive solution for creature effects with muscle, skin and face solvers. Currently, it is implemented as a plug-in for Maya and Houdini. The key values of Adonis are:

- **Fast Computation**. Tipically, high quality creatures simulation requires hours to compute even if running on modern hardware components. The objective of Adonis is to break the current limits in terms of execution times in order to deliver high quality results in seconds which is possible thanks to the latest research in the simulation field for VFX and with Inbibo's proprietary technology. 

- **Quick Setup**. Preparing a creature to be simulated with realistic behaviour and dynamics can be tedious and require a significant amount of time for modelers, riggers and CFX artists. Also, this process often demands a certain knowledge of physically based parameters. However, Adonis enables artists to set up complex creatures simulation in short time thanks to solvers with intuitive parametrization, easy-to-use tools and AI solutions to accelerate the configuration process.

### Key Features

- Integrate simulation in animation rigs
- Get results very rapidly after feedback is received
- Accelerate shots feedback iteration
- Deliver finalised work sooner
- Save time compared to standard previous CFX workflows
