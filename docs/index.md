# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of AdonisFX where we provide you with all the information and knowledge to configure and use Adonis in your characters.

Adonis is a fast and intuitive solution for creature effects with muscle, skin and face solvers working in Maya and Houdini.

### Fast computation

High quality creatures simulation is restricted to high budget VFX shows and require hours to compute each of their iterations. Adonis uses the latest research in simulation, with Inbibo's proprietary technology to deliver high-quality results in seconds, not hours.

### Easy To Setup

Preparing a creature to be simulated with realistic behavior and dynamics should not require tedious modeling, rigging and CFX processes. Adonis is developed to allow artists to set up complex creatures simulations in minutes.

### Key Features

Adonis provides specialized solvers for muscles, fascia, skin and facial simulation.
