### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the internal bounding box construction at start time to use the current point positions instead of the point positions at rest. *AdonisFX-1511*

### Deprecated

- The AdnWeightsDisplayNode is deprecated. This deprecation is fully backward-compatible, ensuring that scenes created in earlier versions will work as expected in version 1.4.0. To safely remove deprecated nodes from your scenes, a utility is added in AdonisFX Menu > Utils > *Upgrade Deprecated Nodes*.

### Known Limitations

- Undoing the removal of inputs in AdnGlue does not restore the previous painted weights. *AdonisFX-1523*

## Version 1.3.1

### Improvements

- Improved the floating licensing setup to allow connection with both interactive and batch servers without the need of a switch in the environment configuration. This change is fully backward compatible. *AdonisFX-1384*

- Implemented dynamic loading of AdonisFX shelf and removed the `MAYA_SHELF_PATH` configuration from the module file.
- Improved UX to prevent informative dialogs to prompt.
- Improved UX to prevent dialogs to prompt when running commands from script.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug that was redistributing the masses per point in very specific cases and only if the painted masses map was not the default one.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the velocity damping not to work when point masses were too large.

### Known Limitations

- Interaction muscle-to-muscle is not supported. *AdonisFX-1211*
- Exporter and Importer do not support locators and sensors. *AdonisFX-1215*

## Version 1.2.0

### Core

- Added support for multiple targets in AdnSkin solver.
- Extended the uber constraints initialization to build constraints with the closest point on the closest target.
- Allow all the solvers to use the internal triangulation of the geometry to build the constraints.
- Extended the distance, fiber and shape preservation constraints initialization to build constraints based on the triangulated mesh.
- Added support in AdnSkin solver to simulate even if no targets are provided.

### Maya

- Added two new buttons to the shelf and two new entries in the menu to add and remove targets from an AdnSkin deformer.
- Added support for debugging distance and fiber constraints.

### Known Limitations

- Slide on geometry constraints in Fast mode are limited to simple setups. They need to run in Quality mode to ensure stability in complex scenarios. *AdonisFX-1213*
- Volume ratio gain effect is dependent on the total volume of the muscle. This might require using volume ratios with a range different to the default [0, 2] if needed. *AdonisFX-1137*
- Interaction muscle-to-muscle is not supported. *AdonisFX-1211*
- Exporter and Importer do not support locators and sensors. *AdonisFX-1215*
- Fat simulation is limited to the current features in AdnSkin solver. *AdonisFX-879*

## Version 1.1.2

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug in the Slide Collision Constraints that was overcorrecting in case of intersection with the collider with a magnitude greater than the collision threshold. *AdonisFX-1258*

## Version 1.1.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug in how gravity was evaluated. Now the value from the UI represented in m/s<sup>2</sup> is converted to cm/s<sup>2</sup>. *AdonisFX-1250*

### Considerations for backward compatibility

- Due to the fix introduced in this version, in order to have the scenes created with previous versions work the same way, it is needed to set the gravity value in all AdonisFX nodes divided by 100. For example, if the AdonisFX setup in v1.1.0 (or older) used a gravity of 980, now this attribute needs to be changed to 9.8. If the setup did not use gravity, no adjustment needs to be done.

## Version 1.1.0

- Interaction muscle-to-muscle is not supported. *AdonisFX-1211*
- Exporter and Importer do not support locators and sensors. *AdonisFX-1215*
- Fat simulation is limited to the current features in AdnSkin solver. *AdonisFX-879*

### Core

- Solver for skin simulation.
- Solver for volumetric and planar muscle simulation.
- Solver for facial simulation.
- Proprietary set of constraints integrated in AdonisFX solvers:
    - Fibers contraction
    - Volume preservation
    - Attachments
    - Slide on segment
    - Slide on surface
    - Soft constraint on polygon
    - Hard constraint on polygon
    - Slide collision on surface
- A Machine Learning module to extract facial muscles data and their fiber directions from a set of facial expressions.

### Maya

    - AdnSkin
    - AdnMuscle
    - AdnRibbonMuscle
    - AdnSimshape
- Nodes to evaluate relative distances, angles, velocities and accelerations between transform nodes in the scene: AdnSensorPosition, AdnSensorDistance, AdnSensorRotation.
- Locators to visualize relative distances, angles, velocities and accelerations between transform nodes in the scene: AdnLocatorPosition, AdnLocatorDistance, AdnLocatorRotation.
- Plain AdnLocator with a custom shape for visualization purposes.
- AdnEdgeEvaluator: A node to compute the compression map of a deformed geometry.
- AdnWeightsDisplayNode: A node to visualize the paintable maps while painting from the AdonisFX Paint Tool.

- Learn Muscle Patches Tool: An intuitive UI to configure and run the AdnLearnMusclePatches command.
- Sensors Connection Editor: A simple UI to make connections easily from sensors and locators to AdonisFX deformers.
- AdonisFX Paint Tool: Custom tool to manipulate the paintable maps of the AdonisFX deformers to ensure that the solvers receive valid distribution of weights.
- A debugger system composed by an AdnData node and an AdnDebugLocator to visualize information internal to the solvers such as connections to attachments, fiber directions, etc.

### Known Limitations

- The *Max Sliding Distance* parameters in AdnSkin and AdnSimshape are represented in scene units. The higher this value is, the more units in the space the sliding constraint allows a vertex to slide on. If the polygons of the target geometry to slide on are very little compared to that value, then the sliding constraint will be time and memory consuming. *AdonisFX-997*
- The activations debugger in AdnSimshape is limited to the Parallel and Serial evaluation modes. *AdonisFX-1026*
- The debugger system draws debug data independently to the visibility of the mesh. *AdonisFX-802*
- Enabling and disabling fibers display from the AdonisFX menu does not restore the previous status of the debug settings of the affected deformers. *AdonisFX-998*
- The AdonisFX Paint Tool does not refresh the painted maps if the attachments or the slide on segment constraints are removed while the tool is opened. Restarting the tool is needed. *AdonisFX-999*
- The AdnLocatorRotation does not draw the angle shape if the three inputs (start, mid and end positions) are aligned, i.e. when the angle is 180 degrees. *AdonisFX-1000*
- The Importer tool creates and configures the deformers assuming that all the required inputs exist in the scene. If any of those is not found (e.g. target mesh in AdnSkin), they have to be reassigned to an existing object manually. *AdonisFX-1001*
