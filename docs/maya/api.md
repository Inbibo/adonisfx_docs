# API

### Experimental Python API

A Python API is developed to allow Technical Directors implementing custom Python scripts to automate the manipulation of AdonisFX nodes. The main objective is to provide the ability to build an AdonisFX rig fully configured from script. It allows users to extract the setup from an a rig in Maya, export and save that information into a JSON file, and also import that configuration from file to a rig in another Maya scene.

This API is in its **experimental phase** which means that it is likely to change in upcoming releases. Because of that, please do not hesitate to send an email to **adnsupport@inbibo.co.uk** to provide any feedback and/or requests. The support and development teams will work together to incorporate users' feedback to consolidate the implementation and support additional scenarios.

> [!NOTE]
> - The Python API can be found in AdonisFX/python/adn/api/experimental_api.py.
> - Navigate through the code to get familiar with the code.
> - Contact support if you need further assistance.
