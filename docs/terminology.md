# Terminology

### Constraints

Constraints are rules that an Adonis solver applies during simulation to ensure that the relationship between elements involved in the simulation, such as geometry points, attachments, rig joints or external meshes, is maintained.

##### Attachment Constraint

An attachment constraint defines the location of a geometry point in the local space of a transform object.

##### Distance Constraint

A distance constraint defines the relationship between two geometry points, i.e. the distance at the rest.

##### Fiber Constraint

A fiber constraint defines the relationship between two points of a muscle geometry. It is an specialization of the distance constraint where the muscle fibers flow is taken into consideration to emulate the behavior of a real fiber contraction.

##### Hard Constraint

A hard constraint defines the location of a geometry point in the tangent space of a polygon.

##### Slide Constraint

A slide constraint defines the distance between a geometry point and a surface. This constraint allows the point to travel along the surface.

##### Slide Collision Constraint

A slide collision constraint is an extension of a slide constraint that includes information about the relative orientation of the point against the surface (inside/outside) plus the ability to allow the point to be closer to the surface up to a given threshold.

##### Slide On Segment Constraint

A slide on segment constraint defines the relationship between a geometry point and a segment defined by two transform objects. This constraint aims to keep the point at a certain distance to the segment but with the possibility of traveling along the segment.

##### Soft Constraint

A soft constraint defines the relationship between a geometry point and another point of a different geometry. This constraints aims to keep the point at a certain distance to the external geometry point without any restrictions of relative orientation.

##### Uber

A uber constraint is a compound of hard, slide and soft constraint.

##### Volume

A volume constraint defines the volume at rest of a geometry.

### Locator

Locators are intended to visualize the output of an Adonis sensor. There are three types of locators that require a specific number of inputs and adopt custom shapes in the viewport: position (a squared box at the location of a node), distance (a parallelepiped with a line connecting two nodes) and rotation (an angle with two segments connecting three nodes). Each type is associated with its homologous sensor.

### Muscle patches

A muscle patch is a group of connected geometry vertices that represent an internal muscle projected onto the skin. A muscle patch is not an actual modelled geometry. Muscle patches are used by AdnSimshape solver for facial simulation, The muscle patches of a facial geometry can be generated with the Learn Muscle Patches tool which applies Machine Learning techniques to estimate the distribution of muscles based on the set of facial expressions that a facial rig can reproduce.

##### Adonis Muscle Patches File

The Adonis Muscle Patches File is a propietary file format that stores the distribution of muscle patches generated by the Learn Muscle Patches tool. The file extension is `amp`.

### Ribbon Muscle

The ribbon muscle or **AdnRibbonMuscle** is an Adonis solver for muscle simulation. It allows to apply dynamics such as fibers contraction to a planar geometry.

### Sensor
Sensors are nodes to measure positions, distances, angles, velocities and accelerations. There are three types of sensors that require different number of input transform objects: position (one single input to compute its velocity and acceleration), distance (two inputs to compute the distance between them and their relative velocity and acceleration) and rotation (three inputs to compute the angle between them and the angular velocity and acceleration). Each type is associated with its homologous locator that will allow to visualize the output values.

### Simshape

Simshape or **AdnSimshape** is an Adonis solver for facial simulation. It allows to apply dynamics on top of the the deformation driven by a facial rig. Also, it has the ability to mimic the change in rigidity of the skin due to the activation of the internal facial muscles.Patches. 

### Skin

Skin or **AdnSkin** is an Adonis solver for skin and fascia simulation. It allows to apply dynamics to the skin of a character to produce realistic effects like wrinkles.

### Volumetric Muscle

The volumetric muscle or **AdnVolumetricMuscle** is an Adonis solver for muscle simulation. It allows to apply dynamics such as fibers contraction and volume gain to a geometry.
