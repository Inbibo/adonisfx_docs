# AdnLocators

A fundamental part of Adonis is the ability to visualize and measure different tranforms so that they can serve as input information for the deformers. This is what adnLocators are meant to be: elements in the scene from which relative information from scene elements (such as position, velocity, angle formed...) can be gathered for later use.

## AdnLocatorPosition

AdnLocatorPosition is the Adonis locator for visualizing the velocity and acceleration of a single transform node.

### Create AdnLocatorPosition

Only one transform will e required to create the AdnLocatorPosition. The process that we must follow to do so is as following:

 1. Select a scene object with a transform node
 2. Press the ![AdnLocatorPosition button](images/adn_point_locator.png) button in the AdonisFX shelf or press *Position* in the AdonisFX menu, under the *Locators* submenu.
 3. The AdnLocatorPosition is created and ready to be used.

## AdnLocatorDistance

AdnLocatorDistance is the Adonis locator for visualizing the relative distance, velocity and acceleration between two transform nodes.

### Create AdnLocatorDistance

Only one transform will e required to create the AdnLocatorPosition. The process that we must follow to do so is as following:

 1. Select a scene object with a transform node
 2. Press the ![AdnLocatorPosition button](images/adn_point_locator.png) button in the AdonisFX shelf or press *Position* in the AdonisFX menu, under the *Locators* submenu.
 3. The AdnLocatorPosition is created and ready to be used.

### How to use

Adonis locators will only let the user visualize the relative information from the transform nodes to which they are applied. To be able to read this information and apply it to a deformer we will need an []

## AdnLocatorRotation

AdnLocatorRotation is the Adonis locator for visualizing the angle, angular velocity and angular acceleration between three transform nodes.

### Create AdnLocatorRotation

Only one transform will e required to create the AdnLocatorPosition. The process that we must follow to do so is as following:

 1. Select a scene object with a transform node
 2. Press the ![AdnLocatorPosition button](images/adn_point_locator.png) button in the AdonisFX shelf or press *Position* in the AdonisFX menu, under the *Locators* submenu.
 3. The AdnLocatorPosition is created and ready to be used.

AdnLocator is an Adonis native alternative to Maya locators.
