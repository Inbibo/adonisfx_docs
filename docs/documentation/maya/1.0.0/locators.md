# AdnLocators

A fundamental part of Adonis is the ability to visualize and measure different tranforms so that they can serve as input information for the deformers. This is what adnLocators are meant to be: elements in the scene from which relative information from scene elements (such as position, velocity, angle formed...) can be gathered for later use.

## AdnLocatorPosition

AdnLocatorPosition is the Adonis locator for visualizing the velocity and acceleration of a single transform node.

## AdnLocatorDistance

AdnLocatorDistance is the Adonis locator for visualizing the relative distance, velocity and acceleration between two transform nodes.

## AdnLocatorRotation

AdnLocatorRotation is the Adonis locator for visualizing the angle, angular velocity and angular acceleration between three transform nodes.
