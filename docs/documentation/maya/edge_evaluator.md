# AdnEdgeEvaluator

The AdnEdgeEvaluator node is a dependency node that computes deformation changes in edges. Based on two input meshes it will output a compression map of the edges.

## Requirements

The Edge Evaluator Node requires the following inputs to be provided:

  - <b class="mesh_color"> Rest Mesh (R):</b> Mesh with no deformation or animation.
  - <b class="mesh_color"> Deform Mesh (D):</b> Mesh with deformations in its geometry. These deformations are not generated by the animation of a rig.

> [!NOTE]
> - All input geometries must have the same number of vertices and edges.

## Create the Edge Evaluator Node

1. Select the deform mesh, then the rest mesh.
2. Go to the AdonisFX menu > *Create* Nodes > Edge Evaluator.

# Attributes

#### Time Attributes
- **Initialization Time** (Time, *Current frame*): Sets the frame at which the data will be initialized.

#### Compression Remap
- **Compression Remap** (Ramp Attribute): Curve to remap the output compression map.

## AdnSimshape Activation using Edge Evaluator node

The evaluator node might be used to drive the [activations of an AdnSimshape](simshape.md#muscle-activations) deformer. It can be done by connecting the output map to the activations plug of AdnSimshape. Adonis provides a menu option to recreate this steps easily.

1. Select the Edge Evaluator Node. Then the Simshape deformer node.
2. Go to the AdonisFX Menu > *Edit* Simshape > Connect Activations Plug.

In order to disconnect the plug, repeat the selection and instead of pressing *Connect Activations Plug* press *Disconnect Activations Plug*.
