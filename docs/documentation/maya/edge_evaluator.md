# How To Use

The Edge Evaluator Node is a dependency node that computes deformation changes in edges. Based on two input meshes will output a compression map of the edges.

## Requirements

The Edge Evaluator Node requires the following inputs to be provided:

  - <b class="mesh_color"> Rest Mesh (R) </b> with no deformation or animation.
  - <b class="mesh_color"> Deform Mesh (D)</b> with deformations in its geometry. This deformations are not generated by the animation of a rig.

> [!NOTE]
> - All input geometries must have the same number of vertices and edges.

## Create the Edge Evaluator Node

1. Select the meshes in the following order:
    ``` mermaid
    graph LR
      A["Deform Mesh"] --> B;
      B["Rest Mesh"];
    ```
2. Go to the AdonisFX menu > *Create* Nodes > Edge Evaluator.

# Attributes

#### Time Attributes
- **Initialization Time** (Time, *Current frame*): Sets the frame at which the data will be initialized.

#### Compression Remap
- **Compression Remap** (Ramp attribute): Curve to remap the output compression map.

## Simshape Activation using Edge Evaluator node

The evaluator node might be used to drive the [activations of a Simshape](simshape.md#muscle-activations) deformer. It can be done by connecting the output map to the activations plug of Simshape. Adonis provides a menu option to recreate this steps easily.

1. Select the Edge Evaluator Node. Then the Simshape deformer node.
2. Go to the AdonisFX Menu > *Edit* Simshape > Connect Activations Plug.

If you want to disconnect the plug repeat the selection and instead of pressing "Connect Activations Plug" press "Disconnect Activations Plug".
